# Angular4 + Systemjs module loader
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-badge-url]

This repo is forked from [angular.io quickstart], then added a third party library cornerstone to do window leveling on image.

1. Before run the application, install:

- node: 6.11.3
- yarn: 0.24.5

2. Use command `yarn install` to install `node_modules`

3. Run command `yarn run start` to run the application

4. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in Chrome

5. Click "window leveling" button multiple time, a cornerstone for loop timer will output in the console. It's pretty fast and stable, it tooks about 0.013 for each click.
